# Description
I decided to take a look into web dev. 
Thus I bought the domain salemsalleh.de and decided to build a personal website.
At first I thought it would be sufficient to just stick to html and css to do the project,
but I realized that I would like to take the chance and learn about a state of the art tech in that field.
As I was chatting with a friend of mine about his new role he told me about react.js .
That's why I chose react for this project. 

## Structure
1. Home
 - when entering a progress bar is loading
 - terminal like style (bash)
2. About
 - Venn Diagram 
3. Contact
 - graphs in background
4. Projects
 - looks like a ERD where an entity equals a plattform (concepts)
