# Description
I decided to take a look into web dev. Thus I bought the domain salemsalleh.de and decided to build a personal website.\
At first I thought it would be sufficient to just stick to html and css to do the project,\
but I realized that I would like to take the chance and learn about a state of the art tech in that field.\
As I was chatting with a friend of mine about his new role he told me about react.js in the first place.
