          I began as an economics and business student.
          In my part-time job, I had to cope with tedious reporting tasks.
          After taking a Business Intelligence and Data Mining class, I was able to automate and optimize these.
          This experience motivated me to redirect my career towards the data space.
          I wrote my thesis in business informatics and started my first full-time job as a system manager at a media agency.
          I transitioned to the Business Intelligence department and began using relational databases to streamline reporting efforts.
          As our infrastructure improved, I shifted my focus to data integration and data transformation tasks.
          I found it very inspiring to work in an environment that encourages constant learning and development.
